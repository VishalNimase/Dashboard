                    This Air- Conditioning Test Rig is designed such that any outdoor unit of any company may be tested. For this instance we have used a 1.5 ton BlueStar Air Conditioning unit liked to its equivalent indoor units.
                    You can see the variation of temperatures/pressures/humidity of various locations in real time.
                    This will help in finding the real time data of all the parameters.
                    Easier to define the location of fault, parameters to changed and process control.
